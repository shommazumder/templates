# My Latex Templates

These are my latex templates for my research articles as well as teaching slides and notes. Eventually, I'll be converting my workflow over to markdown entirely so I will be posting updates hopefully pretty often. 

This effort is heavily inspired by [Kieran Healy's](https://github.com/kjhealy/latex-custom-kjh) incredible resources for those looking to have plain text and reproducible workflows.
